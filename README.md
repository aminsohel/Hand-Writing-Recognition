# Hand-Writing-Recognition

Hand writing recognition from Image Data 

# Data 

Data is collected from IAM image dataset and the images was forr word in my case: https://fki.tic.heia-fr.ch/databases/download-the-iam-handwriting-database

# Environment 

1. Python
2. Google colab
3. Tensorflow and Keras
4. Pandas and Numpy
5. Matplotlib for visualization
   
# Neueral Network Models ( Lenet-5 Model and VGG-16 model)
  1. CNN Layers (Convolutional Neural Networks): It was used in the convolution blocks for extracting the features.
  2. Dense Layers was Relu activation function.
  3. RNN Layers (Recurrent Neural Networks) Bidirectional LSTM is used for sequence modelling.
  4. Softmax activation function is used for output layer.
  5. Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is used for loss calculaation.
  6. Adam optimizer and accuracy metric. is used for model compilation.
